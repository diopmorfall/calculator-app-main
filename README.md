## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to recreate a basic calculator, and to handle click and keydown events to write and compute mathematical expressions


### Continued development

This is not completed, it has a bunch of issues that need to be solved:
- proper handling of division between decimal numbers;
- handling of more than one operation in an expression;
- correct working of the background color change of each key after clicking on them for the last two themes, just like for the first one

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) - A great site with a lot of JavaScript concepts explained clearly
- [IavaScript Event Keycodes](https://keycode.info/) - This is an amazing site that helped me identify quickly the key codes I needed
